As India emerges from the enduring impacts of the pandemic, organizations need to change faster than ever before to address the profound challenges that they face and also make most of the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead of them. PWC as a community of solvers is uniquely positioned to bring the right combination of people, capabilities and technology. That's what we're calling. The new equation. The new equation focuses on two interconnected needs that client face today. The need to build trust with a broader set of stakeholders and also to deliver sustained outcomes. To enable our clients to meet these challenges over the next five years, we will double down on our investments in some of the key growth areas. Our people are at the core of our success. We will continue to spend a minimum of 1% of our revenue in upskilling our people and our partners. At the same time, We also have tremendous focus on onboarding fresh talent. We will be increasing our campus hiring by five times in the next five years. We also expect to add over 2,000 jobs every year. And most importantly, we commit to ensuring a minimum of 40% diversity across our teams. We are going to set up the PwC Research Institute, which will identify and analyze the emerging trends across sectors. We will further invest in emerging industries. technologies, digital and cloud, artificial intelligence and analytics, cyber and managed services and work closely with our ecosystems and alliances to offer value-added as well as differentiated services to all our clients. I'm excited about the difference we will make to businesses around the world and in India. It all adds up to the new equation.
